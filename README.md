 My Inventory4U app, helps business owners, warehouse managers and anyone with inventory storage needs with their inventory. On this app, a user can track their inventory stock.
Increase or decrease the number of a certain item, and sign up for alerts when inventory is empty or an item is at a low volume. My UI designs address all the user's needs. Being able
To view their items with a grid. Having a login and registration page to sign in or create an account. Having a notification page to recieve alerts.

My approach to coding was to start with the most challenging stuff. I started with the grid and Item page, since they have the most complex features. I then go on to the Login and registration page, and to the
Notification page. This strategy is what I plan on doing in the future, starting with the most challenging.

Testing my code reveals there were a lot of errors that were overlooked and were forced to flix. I click on the run page, watching for errors that appear in the terminal. This process was important, for without it
I would have submitted an inferior version.

Connecting the registration page with the Login page was the most challenging component. I have to create a logRegister.setOnClickListener, for the 'create account' button to open the Register page.

The layout features of the app, where I succeeded at. Knowing what the User will look for and use. Knowing where the user expected those features to be at.
